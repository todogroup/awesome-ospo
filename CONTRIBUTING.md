We welcome improvements and suggestions! Please consider these guidelines:

## General guidelines

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion using the provided template
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate

- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome

## Add a new tool or project

When submitting a new tool or project, please provide context to help reviewers understand your suggestion:

### Why is this tool/project needed?
