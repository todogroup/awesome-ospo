# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for maintaining and validating the awesome-ospo repository.

## Requirements

Both scripts require Python 3 and use only standard library modules:
- `urllib.request` and `urllib.error` for HTTP requests
- `urllib.parse` for URL parsing

## Note

Before running the scripts, you may need to update the hardcoded file paths in the scripts to match your local repository structure.
